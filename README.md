CSS Only Tab Navigation
==========

A simple tab navigation made with pure CSS, with no Javascript required.

The idea here is pretty simple:
1. We needed an element with two different states;
2. These states must managable through CSS => a simple radio input!
3. Each radio will represent a tab
4. Must be accessible (always!)

With that in mind, a simple tab navigation is born using radio input and its :checked state. 
For accessibility purposes, we can highlight the tab labels when an input is on focus, allowing the user to navigate using keyboard arrows.

Take a look and feel free to use it!
